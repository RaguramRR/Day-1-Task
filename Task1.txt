Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP2 can send mulitiple data request over 1TCP connection while HTTP1 requires many TCP connection.
HTTP2 reduces additional round trip time (RTT), making your website load faster.
HTTP1.1 used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles. HTTP2 will use binary commands to execute the same tasks.
HTTP2 will convert the same text commands into binary before transmitting it over the network.
HTTP2 has Less prone to errors, Lighter network footprint, Effective network resource utilization, Reduced network latency and improved throughput.
HTTP2 is Efficient and robust in terms of processing of data between client and server.
HTTP2 allows the client saves pushed resources in the cache, the client can reuse these cached resources across different pages.
HTTP2 can prioritize pushed resources.
HTTP2 provides many new mechanics over HTTP1.1 and also solves the issues in HTTP1.1 and thus this boosts web page preformance.
